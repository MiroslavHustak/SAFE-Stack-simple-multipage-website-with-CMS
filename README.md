A simple website created from a SAFE Stack standard template. The website was originally created in ASP MVC(C#) and I have been re-writting it for learning purposes.


The web pages are in a rudimentary state and are very unsafe to use - learning/coding is still ongoing. The code contains many lines for learning purposes only. Currently working (time permitting) on routing, validations, exceptions and safety features.
