A simple website created from a SAFE Stack standard template. The website was originally created in ASP MVC(C#) and I have been re-writting it for learning purposes.


The web pages are in a rudimentary state - coding is still ongoing. Currently working (time permitting) on validations, exceptions and safety features.
