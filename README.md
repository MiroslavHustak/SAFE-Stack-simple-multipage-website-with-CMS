A simple multi-page website with a very basic content management system was created using the SAFE Stack standard template, following the guidance of the Elmish Book and incorporating client-side routing code by Maxime Mangel. The website features an HTML/CSS template designed by others (see the footer of the website for credits). The site was originally built with ASP.NET MVC (C#). When the client requested an improved CMS for this website, I decided to re-write the entire application in F# to familiarize myself with Elmish and SAFE Stack.

The code is currently under review.
