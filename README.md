A very simple multi-page website with a very simple content management system created from the SAFE Stack standard template with the help of the Elmish Book and code for client-side routing by Maxime Mangel. The website was originally created in ASP.NET MVC(C#) and I have been re-writting it into F# for learning purposes.

The coding is still ongoing. The code contains many lines for learning purposes only. Currently working (time permitting) on a database option for the CMS (alongside an already-made Json/XML solution), first in plain T-SQL, then in Dapper. Validations, exceptions, and safety features will be added later. And, of course, final code refactoring will be done in the finalisation period :-).
