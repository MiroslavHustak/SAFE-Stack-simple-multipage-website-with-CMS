A simple multi-page website created from a SAFE Stack standard template with the help of the Elmish Book and code for routing by Maxime Mangel. The website was originally created in ASP.NET MVC(C#) and I have been re-writting it for learning purposes.

The coding is still ongoing. The code contains many lines for learning purposes only. Currently working (time permitting) on a database for the CMS. Validations, exceptions and safety features will be added later.
