A simple website created from a SAFE Stack standard template with the help of the Elmish Book and code for routing by Maxime Mangel. The website was originally created in ASP MVC(C#) and I have been re-writting it for learning purposes.

The web pages are in a rudimentary state - learning/coding is still ongoing. The code contains many lines for learning purposes only. Currently working (time permitting) validations, exceptions and safety features. A database will be added later.
